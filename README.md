Additional Notes:
1. The PowerPoint was submitted here because I forgot to submit on Sakai. Hopefully the time of file submission will serve as evidence that it was almost on-time
2. The Modifications page display's errors if there are any but if its successful, it doesn't provide any feedback. This is just an issue with the front end, the functionality works as intended
   * I hope no points will be deducted for the front-end portion and functionality will be prioritized more (based on my in-class talks with Professor Ames)
